Currently:
An asteroids clone with wavelet meachanics instead of shooting.

Eventually:
An extra-dimensional 2D space game written with pygame.
Single player, PVE, looter-shooter with tower defence elements.


To shorten interstellar trade routes, InterDimTrade Inc. egineers have found a way to travel through other parts of the multiverse, called branes.
The laws of physics in these branes are different, making the travel dangerous. So InterDimTrade has hired you to find or build safe trade routes through BraneSpace to a number of systems.
